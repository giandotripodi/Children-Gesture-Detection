# Children-Gesture-Detection
In my thesis work, I built a multi-level IA system for gesture recognition (in particular the recognition of gesture pointing) in ASD subjects. The system consists in 4 levels:

• Convolutional neural network (CNN) for children detection (I level). 86% accuracy

• CNN Mediapipe model for hand detection (II level). 95% accuracy

• Artificial Neural Network for gesture classification (III level). 98% accuracy

• Clustering for detecting number of pointing events (IV level).
